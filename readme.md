#This is a blog app created in python-flask,a microframework.
The application also demonstrates the use of various external 
apis,which automates most of the work.

sqlalchemy,fulfils the db requirement,placed as an url within the code.
the application's UI is autogenerated
Further prospect can be adding stormpath to manage logins,registration and logouts
simple demo of stormpath's usage:
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['DEBUG'] = True
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret'
app.config['STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE'] = 'apiKey.properties'
app.config['STORMPATH_APPLICATION'] = 'flaskr'

stormpath_manager = StormpathManager(app)
@app.route('/')
def show_posts():

the scope of this project can also be further enhanced by adding other features of text-search and dashboard
