#This is a blog app created in python-flask,a microframework.
#The application also demonstrates the use of various external 
#apis,which automates most of the work.

#sqlalchemy,fulfils the db requirement,placed as an url within the code.
#the application's UI is autogenerated
#Further prospect can be adding stormpath to manage logins,registration and logouts
#simple demo of stormpath's usage:
#app = Flask(__name__)
#app.config['DEBUG'] = True
#app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '9wwUw8fSxTF6XRgWVFK1j6ZF/I8XiHEzPvQeFwZ+zfc'
#app.config['STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE'] = 'apiKey.properties'
#app.config['STORMPATH_APPLICATION'] = 'flaskr'

stormpath_manager = StormpathManager(app)
#@app.route('/')
#def show_posts():

#the scope of this project can also be further enhanced by adding other features of text-search and dashboard
